# Usage with REXPaint

https://www.gridsagegames.com/rexpaint/

To use this font with REXPaint, open the file data/fonts/dungeon-mode_config.xt
and copy its contents to the end of your own "_config.xt", located within the
data/fonts/ directory of your REXPaint installation.

Also copy the .png files under data/fonts/ and (optionally) the palette (.txt)
file under data/palettes.

To check if everything is set up correctly, load the example image (.xp) under
images/ and compare it to the .png export in the same folder.

For more information, see the "Custom and Extended Fonts" section of the
REXPaint manual:
